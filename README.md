In this project, we are going to investigate Melbourne Housing Market trend.
We are going to predict the trend of housing prices based on some of 
the different features such as type of housing, number of rooms, land size, distance from council area, suburb region 
the housing is located in, etc. Based on the visualization of the trend of housing prices with respect to different features, 
we can advise wisely to buy a house of particular interest in Melbourne or not. The problem we are trying to investigate is of utter importance 
because it is very necessary to understand the real estate trends of a place, especially which suffering from a real estate housing bubble, to avoid risk 
and make sensible decision on investment.   

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market
The entire dataset includes two csv files, 
which provide information of houses sold and their respective properties such as address, number of rooms, 
type of housing, price, and distance to council area.

Specifically, we are going to examine the timeline of the housing bubble, its trend via variables, 
such as the overall price, amount sold/unsold, change in amount of rentals as well as housing, and changes in various regions. 
Furthermore, we examine the correlation between factors, and select top sellers in Melbourne and give suggestions to investors.
